# Book Sorting Project

This project demonstrates sorting books using `TreeSet` and custom comparators in Java.

## Book Class

The `Book` class represents a book with attributes such as name, author, page number, and release date.

## Comparator for Page Numbers

The `PageComparator` class compares books based on their page numbers.

## Sorting by Book Name

Books are sorted in alphabetical order based on their names using `compareTo` in the `Book` class.

## Sorting by Page Numbers

Books are sorted based on their page numbers using the `PageComparator`.

## Usage

The `Main` class demonstrates how to create books, sort them by name and page number, and print the sorted lists.

## Output

The sorted books are displayed in the console, first by name and then by page number.
